## 📝 Project Synopsis

### ❗ Problem Statement
Local governments lack transparent, inclusive, and scalable ways to get feedback from citizens. Community decisions often exclude those without access to physical town halls or meetings. Trust is low due to unverifiable voting mechanisms and political bias.

### 💡 Planned Solution
Civica is a digital platform that enables citizens to participate in community voting and provide feedback online. The platform leverages Fayda for secure, identity-verified participation, ensuring that only eligible community members can vote or submit feedback. Civica provides a user-friendly interface for submitting proposals, voting, and tracking results in real time, making the process transparent and accessible to all.

### 🎯 Expected Outcome
- Increased citizen participation in local governance
- Transparent and auditable voting and feedback processes
- Reduced political bias and manipulation
- Scalable solution for communities of any size

### 🛡️ Fayda's Role
Fayda is used as the core identity verification mechanism. By integrating Fayda, Civica ensures that all votes and feedback are tied to real, verified individuals, preventing fraud and duplicate submissions. This builds trust in the process and ensures compliance with local regulations.
